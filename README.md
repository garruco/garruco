## 💡 About Me

I'm a researcher and designer focused on crafting interactive systems that evoke emotion through the interplay of sound, visuals, and movement. My work explores how people *feel*, *interpret*, and *make sense* of digital artifacts hrough a human-centered and phenomenological lens.

I work at the intersection of:

- **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**  
- **Human-Centered Design & Co-Design**  
- **Accessibility & Sensory Translation**  
- **Generative Games & Dynamic Audiovisual Systems**

## 🧠 Featured Projects

- 🎮 **Emotional Generative Game**  
  A prototype designed to explore how audiovisual elements can shape emotional experiences. Player actions dynamically alter the environment, and post-play interviews help reveal how meaning and intention emerge.

- 👁️‍🗨️ **Accessible Sensory Landscapes**  
  An ongoing project that translates visual input into abstract soundscapes to support spatial awareness for visually impaired users.

- 🎧 **Emotional Sound Library**  
  A collection of custom-made sounds designed to influence human perception, mood, and atmosphere in interactive experiences.
