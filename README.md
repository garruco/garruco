## 💡 About Me

I'm a researcher and designer focused on crafting interactive systems that evoke emotion through the interplay of sound, visuals, and movement. My work explores how people *feel*, *interpret*, and *make sense* of digital artifacts hrough a human-centered and phenomenological lens.

I work at the intersection of:

- **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**  
- **Human-Centered Design & Co-Design**  
- **Accessibility & Sensory Translation**  
- **Generative Games & Dynamic Audiovisual Systems**

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools

- **Languages**: JavaScript, React, Processing
- **Prototyping & Design**: Figma, Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere, After Effects
